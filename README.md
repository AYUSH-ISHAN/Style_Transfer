<h1><B>STYLE TRANSFER</B></h1>

# Introduction:

Neural networks had got an emmense popularity due to their never ending scope. Here, I have presented the code work of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">Style Transfer</a> Paper.
The basic idea behind style tranfer is that it takes the style of an image and merges it with the contents of other image. As a result, we get a
combination of two images.

# My Work:
Here, I am represting the vode work of Style tranfer paper as well as the different outputs got after changing the hyperparameters (here, the Style loss
Weight and the Content loss weight).

# Files and Folders Introduction:
1. <B>Style_transfer.py</B> is the main file having python code of style transfers from scratch based on the Style Transfer paper.
2. <B>Style_transfers-using_tensorflow_power.py</B>, this file is based on implementation of Style Transfer based on inbuilt Tensorflow Modules 
and functions.
3. <B>sample_image</B> - This folder has images which we took as sample or the images on which we applied the style of other images.
4. <B>style_images</B> - This folder has images which we took as Style imaegs. That is the imaegs from whch we borrow the styles.
5. <B>combinaions</B> - this is the folder containing the final output image.
