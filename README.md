<h1><B>STYLE TRANSFER</B></h1>

# Introduction:

Neural networks had got an emmense popularity due to their never ending scope. Here, I have presented the code work of <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">Style Transfer</a> Paper.
The basic idea behind style tranfer is that it takes the style of an image and merges it with the contents of other image. As a result, we get a
combination of two images.

# My Work:
Here, I am represting the vode work of Style tranfer paper as well as the different outputs got after changing the hyperparameters (here, the Style loss
Weight and the Content loss weight).

# Files Introduction:
Here, <B>Style_transfer.py</B> is the main file having python code of style transfers from scratch based on the Style Transfer paper.
Next, we have <B>Style_transfers-using_tensorflow_power.py</B>, this file is based on implementation of Style Transfer based on inbuilt Tensorflow Modules 
and functions.
